# PersonalBossPowers

## About

PersonalBossPowers is a mod that ensures only players who are near a boss kill are rewarded with the Boss Power. It also automatically sets boss trophies on Boss Stones for those players.

## Features

- Players within a server-configurable radius of a boss death are rewarded for the Boss Kill.
- Players credited with a boss kill will see the boss head on boss stones, while others who were not credited will not.
- Players who can see the boss head on the boss stone can activate the boss power for that head. Others who cannot see the head will not be able to hang boss heads on boss stones.

## Installation Notes

The mod is required on both the server and clients.

## Config File

After the first run, a `PersonalBossPowers.cfg` file will be created in the config folder. The `BossKillDistance` is set to 40 by default, which is the distance a player needs to be within to get credit for a boss kill. This is server-synched, so whatever is written on a dedicated server is used by clients in dedicated server games.

## Manual Installation

1. Download the latest copy of Bepinex as per the author's instructions.
2. Place the dll file inside the "Bepinex\plugins\" folder on both the client and server (if you have one).
